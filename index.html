		<p>I am a computer engineering graduate from Tribhuvan University, Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk Campus. I am currently working on mobile based technologies for efficient data collection and real-time analytics for UNICEF Nepal. My primary interests lie in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. I am also an AI Fellow at Fusemachines Nepal.</p>
		<p>In my free time, I love to explore topics on mathematics and physics, history of science, nature of mind and consciousness, Darwinian evolution and evolutionary biology among others. The universe fascinates me, and the fact that we are an insignificant part of the cosmos, inspires me look up in the sky at night for long hours. Occasionally, I love to capture pictures, and do so with my phone. I am also a Nepalese bamboo flute player and can play somewhat decent melodies.</p>
		<p>I have always wanted to maintain a habit of writing regularly, and that was the initial motivation for maintaining a blog. But, to my despair, my blog has turned into a long abandoned haunted space. I hope that my blog will get to see the light of the day in some near future.</p>
		<p>Please refer my resume if your are interested in hiring me for relevant jobs.</p>
