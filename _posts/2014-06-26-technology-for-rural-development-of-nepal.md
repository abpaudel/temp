*Technology for Rural Development of Nepal*Â is a short animated video that I made as an assignment. This assignment was given to me when I applied to become Microsoft Student Partner from my college, Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk Campus.

It features what I would do to develop rural Nepal using technology if I became the Country Director of Microsoft Innovation Center Nepal.
