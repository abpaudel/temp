Tanpura is a long-necked plucked string instrument found in various forms in Indian music; it does not play melody but rather supports and sustains the melody of another instrument or singer by providing a continuous harmonic bourdon or drone. It is not played in rhythm with the music, as the precise timing of plucking a cycle of four strings in a continuous loop is a determinant factor in the resultant sound.

Tanpura for Windows 8.1 is the digital version of traditional Tanpura. This app has features to play Sa-Pa from lower A to middle B scales. You can easily change the key and adjust volume as required.

It has been developed as a universal app. So, it is available to download in the Windows 8.1 Store in both PC and Windows Phone for free.
