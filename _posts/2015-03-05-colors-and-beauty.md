These colors, colors of hope  
Colors of happiness and joy  
Red and green and blue  
I wish, would last forever  
Like the colors of the stars  
Twinkling in the dark night  
Even in the new moon  

Beauty over the enigmatic beauty  
Oh dear, is this a trance?  
Let me stay here forever  
Until the dusk, the night and the morning  
And then the other day  
Only to see these colors again  
Is it the beautiful color?  
Or your colorful beauty?  
That stops me for the pursuit  
The pursuit of my dream  
That drives my emotions  
The emotions of beautiful colors  
And oh my dear, your colorful beauty
